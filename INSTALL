You MUST provide the following flags to configure:

        --with-ffcall=<dir>:
                where ffcall's callback.h header is located

        --with-camlidl=<dir>:
                where camlidl's caml/camlidlruntime.h is found


If you provide --with-examples then you must declare aswell

        --with-camlidl-lib=<dir>:
                where camlidl's libcamlidl.a is found


If you have installed your libpcap library in a different path than /usr/lib
you have to declare:

        --with-libpcap=<dir>
                where libpcap.a/libpcap.so is found


Example configure options for a default system:

        ./configure --with-ffcall=/usr/local/include --with-camlidl=\
        /usr/local/lib/ocaml --with-camlidl-lib=/usr/local/lib/ocaml/\
        --with-examples
